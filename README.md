# LockWhenGone
A script that automatically locks the computer when your phone or other device is undetectable.

## Purpose

The intended purpose of this script is to check every X seconds whether your phone(s) and/or other devices are detectable, and if they aren't, lock the computer automatically. The initial script will check by Bluetooth, and in the future by WiFi and USB.

I have no intention to make this run on Windows or Mac, because I only use Linux.
